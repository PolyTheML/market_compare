*Advanced Applications of Generative AI in Actuarial Science*

# Case Study: GenAI-Driven Market Comparison

## Description

This notebook demonstrates how Generative AI (GenAI) can streamline market comparisons in the insurance industry by extracting and harmonizing key information from unstructured annual reports. We showcase how a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline — combined with Structured Outputs — can efficiently process diverse data formats (e.g., solvency capital ratios, discount rates per duration, risk strategies) to support data-driven decision-making. The approach is adaptable to various document types (e.g., risk reports, sustainability reports, insurance product comparisons) and has significant potential for automating manual and actuarial tasks.

## Getting Started

You can run this notebook locally or on an online platform (Colab, Kaggle, etc.). Clone the repository, install dependencies, and launch Jupyter:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IAA-AITF/Actuarial-AI-Case-Studies.git
cd Actuarial-AI-Case-Studies/case-studies/2025/GenAI-driven_market_comparison
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook GenAI-Driven_Market_Comparison.ipynb
```

Alternatively, open the `.ipynb` directly in Colab after uploading `requirements.txt`.

## Key Takeaways for Actuarial Practice

- **RAG Pipelines**: Efficiently extract relevant information from long, complex reports without context-window limitations.
- **Structured Outputs**: Ensure responses conform to predefined formats, enabling seamless integration into analytical pipelines.
- **Actuarial Domain Expertise**: Critical for prompt design, schema specification, and interpretation of results — underscoring the collaborative role of actuaries in AI-driven workflows.
- **Broad Applicability**: While demonstrated on annual reports, this approach is transferable to other insurance documentation (e.g., risk reports, sustainability disclosures).
